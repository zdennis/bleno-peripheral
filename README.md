# Sample Bleno Peripheral

Note: this is currently a stubbed in peripheral. 

To run on Linux or OSX (it runs better on OSX for me currently than on Linux but that could be my Linux set up):

        npm install
        sudo node peripheral.js

You should see a peripheral that advertises itself either as "MyP" or as the name of your computer. 

If you download the Bluetooth Smart 4.0 app on an iOS device you can find this device and connect with it (to see how pairing/bonding works).
